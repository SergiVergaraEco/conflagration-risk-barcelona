# Conflagration Risk in Barcelona

This repository contains a spatial analysis of conflagration risk in an urban environment.

The study applies density-based clustering (DBSCAN) to identify spatial concentrations of exposure without imposing predefined structures, allowing the detection of areas where localized events can escalate into aggregated loss scenarios.

The results support decision-making in pricing, exposure management, and aggregated risk assessment.
