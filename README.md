# Conflagration Risk in Barcelona

This repository presents a spatial analysis of conflagration risk in an urban environment.

The approach focuses on identifying geographical concentrations of exposure where losses are not independent, and where localized events may escalate into aggregated loss scenarios due to spatial proximity.

Density-based clustering (DBSCAN) is used to detect clusters of exposure without imposing predefined shapes or a fixed number of groups, allowing the identification of structurally relevant accumulations of risk.  
The analysis supports decision-making in pricing, exposure management, and aggregated risk assessment.
